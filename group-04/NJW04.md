## Biogrpahy

Hello I am Nathan I'll just say stuff about this year. I'm in computer science honours at UCT and my honours project is workin with Data Driven Control using RL methods like PPO on systems like an inverted pendulum. I hate Matlab. Other than that I like gaming and gyming :p

## Highlights

I generally enjoy hackathons and just creating something within a time frame and this laser tag web app was basically a hackathon so I'd say that was what I most enjoyed.

## Difficulties

Low points was not having water for 3 days and I haven't properly showered. Also obviously vibe coding brought some issues and difficulties in fixing those issues.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

This was my first time attending and I enjoyed it. I guess one thing could just be more clear at the start with what is wanted I guess, because QR codes were "permitted" but obviously not wanted.
