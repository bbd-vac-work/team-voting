# Bophelo Pharasi

Attendee Type: UFS Student

## Biogrpahy

I’m Bophelo Pharasi, a curious and motivated student from South Africa, currently exploring the world of software development. I like coming across new concepts, trying out new technologies, and experimenting with different frameworks and libraries.

Most of my experience so far comes from CHPC and other learning opportunities. My current tech stack includes C#, HTML, and CSS, and I’ve recently started diving into React. Every new tool I touch sparks more interest in how things work.

I’m aiming to grow into a well-rounded software developer, and I’m not afraid of the learning curve, might freakout a lot but that’s the part I enjoy most when looking back on my experiences.

## Highlights

Learning React and seeing how you can use computer view in just a few days while trying to contribute meaningfully to a team project. I mostly did UI and i like that it looked how i wanted. overall i enjoyed the week.

## Difficulties

This week, my biggest challenges were getting comfortable with React, understanding how component-based views actually work, and still trying to keep up with team progress. It was a lot, but I learned a lot too.

## Recommendations for Improvement

None for now — I’m still learning. I know that mastery takes time, and with only a few days, I don't expect to be coding independently right away. I'm here to learn, grow, and improve with each experience.
