# Tessa Engelbrecht

Attendee Type: BBD Bursar

## Biogrpahy

I'm Tessa Engelbrecht, a Computer Science Honours student with a love for problem-solving, leadership, and bringing ideas to life. I thrive in dynamic environments, whether it's building innovative software solutions or leading projects to success. I've honed my skills in software engineering, mathematics, and artificial intelligence, and I love tackling challenges head-on. When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me on the softball field or mentoring students in mathematics and IT. I'm passionate about learning, teamwork, and leaving things better than I found them.

## Highlights

- Learning to use Computer vision and playing around with the libraries.
- Using some skills I used last year like sockets.
- Playing around with ideas, like adding the blood splatter and being creative.
- Learning from other people and other teams
- Working with a team and getting to share knowledge
- Learning how to stream video with WebRTC

## Difficulties

- Some of my members were struggling with Git and have never worked with JavaScript or frameworks.
- Due to the time constraint, it was difficult balancing time to teach and finishing the product.
- Managing different people working on different sections, especially on CSS with duplicated code.
- Working with models that are not accurate enough and having to change my approach.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Think some of the teams were not as balanced with experience as others, and maybe not just dividing it up into years, but also looking at different experience levels and different universities.
