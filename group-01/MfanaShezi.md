## Biogrpahy

I am Nhlonipho Shezi from Harding Kwazulu Natal , currently completeing my honors in the university of the free state in computer Science .

## Highlights

My hightlights of the week was building our laser game , more on the team collaboration and finally getting the game to work properly 

## Difficulties

1: Having to degug out socket 
2: Seeing Lucky grill one of the least experience team that way he did 

## Reccomendations for imptovements

I think giving teams that are coming to the vac week Higlights on tools they might need to know , so they can learn how to use those tools and be on better footing with everyone especially the new comers , therefore creating a much better experience for everyone where the workload is not carried by 1 or 2 people that have experience ,i believe this will create a much better learning and collaboration experiance
