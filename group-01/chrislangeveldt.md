Attendee Type: BBD Bursar

## Biogrpahy

I am a final year master's student (6th year) at the university of Stellenbosch studying MEng Industrial Engineering with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. But don't worry, I did my undergrad and honours in Computer Science.

## Highlights

The first highlight came at Cape Town airport when I saw the familiar faces of some fellow bursars. I was also excited when I heard what our project was about. My team was great, and I was really happy when our final product worked. The beers after a day of work were also great.

## Difficulties

The idea of working with JavaScript is always a bit scary at first (because I am a Python person), but as soon as I got into it, I really enjoyed it. The biggest difficulty was probably the time pressure and the fact that we had to learn and implement a lot of things in a short time. Also, the arts and crafts part of making the markers wearable was a frustration late at night.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

I actually think a restriction on the use of AI could be a good idea. I think I would have learned more if I had to do everything myself. But that is mostly on me, and not necessarily on BBD.
