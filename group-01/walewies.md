## Biogrpahy

I come from a Ellisras(Lephalale), a mining and electricity production town. I love working with Computers and am currently busy with my second year of Computer Engineering at Tuks.

## Highlights

That moment when there are no more merge conflicts. Finally having an app that works properly and looks presentable. Thinking of a solution to remember user info, even when a socket disconnects and reconnects.

## Difficulties

Having a lot of merge conflicts due to a clear vision of exactly how we were going to approach a certain problem. Getting the app to look presentable. Properly using git to coordinate our coding efforts.

## Reccomendations for imptovements
