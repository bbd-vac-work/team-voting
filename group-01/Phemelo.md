## Biogrpahy

I am a third-year student at UFS majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I aspire to become a Software Engineer.

## Highlights

I got to work on Computer Vision, learned more about JavaScript since I had never used it in an actual project, and also worked with the Canvas.
I had the opportunity to properly understand Git and learned how to work in a team, create branches, and merge different branches. Lastly, I worked on pattern recognition, which was my first time exploring it. Overall, it was a great experience and gave me a good idea of what is expected in a work environment or a graduate project.

## Difficulties

There was a steep learning curve and I had to adjust to many new things, which sometimes meant not getting enough sleep. I also experienced a reality check regarding my own competence and realized how much more there is to learn.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Perhaps making the instruction to be a bit clearer
