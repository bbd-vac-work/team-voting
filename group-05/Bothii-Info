## Biogrpahy

I'm a 4th year computer engineer at UP. My favourite programming language is C++, and I have a great interest in language processing.

## Highlights

I really enjoyed learning about websockets. Also, actually playing the game with my fellow team members was real fun.

## Difficulties

I have not really used generative AI when programming, and I thought this vac week was a good time to do so. Vibe coding is not just having an AI do your work for you, and I struggled to use my agent effectively. I learnt a lot about how to use these tools. Furthermore, it was the first time I used websockets, and had some trouble with originally understanding it.

## Reccomendations for improvements

Perhaps more stricter times on when we should be here/leave.
