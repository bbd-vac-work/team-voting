## Biogrpahy

I’m Siyabonga Mashilwane, a computer science student from Mamelodi, Pretoria. I’m passionate about building things that think — whether it’s writing game engines, crafting algorithms, or diving into the world of AI and cutting-edge tech. I’ve built my own chess AI and ranked in the Top 10 in high performance computing competitions. I'm always looking for the next challenge that pushes me to learn, solve, and create.
## Highlights

The demo was a truly exciting experience. It was inspiring to see the variety of ideas and how different people approached the same problem in unique ways. One of the standout moments was working with WebSockets — discovering what’s possible with real-time communication was both thrilling and eye-opening. Beyond the technical side, the experience also highlighted the value of teamwork and communication. Seeing how collaboration plays such a big role in bringing ideas to life was one of the most beautiful parts of the journey.

## Difficulties
Trying to catch up and learn javascript and sockets in a short amount of time. It was really hard, plus all the different frameworks, and learning how to use them properly without making the code loooking bad.
