## Biography

I am a postgraduate student studying my honours degree in Eletronic Engineering at the University of Pretoria, focusing on intelligent robotics ('vision-language-action' models for robotics). I enjoy programming, robotics, playing the piano, singing, and training for triathlons. Currently, I'm learning how to arrange and produce my own music as a hobby to balance my research work.

## Highlights

1. I was very pleased with our final project. Although my team and I were unsure about the process of developing a complete web application, I am glad we were able to work together with a common vision to deliver a functioning product. I enjoyed solving problems, fixing bugs, and making new features with my teammates - we got along very well!
2. I also enjoyed interacting and talking with people in the other groups. I found it neat to learn how others approached the game problem and designed their application, and I was inspired by the quality of some of the other groups' works - I certainly have a lot to learn!

## Difficulties

A challenge our group encountered was a period of integration hell with the client and server application. Each of us were unsure what each other were doing and what needed to be done, causing our group to stall which spurred some tensions. But thankfully we overcame it by discussing the issue with each other and refocusing our efforts on our minimum viable product. Here, we were able to clearly identify what needed to be implemented to deliver the MVP which got us back on track with minimal delay to progress.

## Recommendation for improvements

I enjoyed the vac week experience. I especially appreciated the standard brief document we could refer to as we built our project. I would recommend that this document would also specify the expectations for the demo presentation. This would only help us streamline our demo preparation and presentation.
