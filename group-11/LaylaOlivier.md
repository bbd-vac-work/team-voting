## Biography

I am completing my BScHons (Computer Science) degree at the University of Pretoria. 

## Highlights

I enjoyed meeting new people and meeting some of the people that I will be working with next year. I also enjoyed building the laser tag game with my team and testing the other team's games.

## Difficulties

A difficulty was originally sending up Render for the web service, but once I got it running, it was easy peasy.

## Recommendations for improvements
