Making a laser tag game with computer vision. The game might not have been perfect but it was fun trying.

## Difficulties

Communication, our group did not communicate enough. Learning websockets was a bit of a struggle.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Have a pre-vac briefing session for first timers so that it is not too overwhelming and know what to expect when coming here.
