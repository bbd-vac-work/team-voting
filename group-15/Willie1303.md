## Biography

I am a 3rd year Data Science student at UFS. I have a interest in building models to solve real-world problems, example using shot data from a football match to create a [xG Model](https://www.hudl.com/blog/expected-goals-xg-explained), that can be used as a metric to shooting abilities of football players.

## Highlights

Creation and usage of the API calls for the LaserTech app.

## Difficulties

- Not being to able to finish the app to what we wanted
- Communication
- Using git in the command line


## Recommendations for improvements

Give information beforehand on what students may need to use in order to create the app (e.g. How to use the command line terminal for git).
