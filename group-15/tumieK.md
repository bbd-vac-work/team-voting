Biography
I am an honours student at University of the Free State,  in Computer Science and Infomatics. I’m passionate about software development, teamwork, and using technology to solve real-world problems. I've participated in an international high-performance computing competition, worked as a student demonstrator and did an intenship at RuxSys. My goal is to become a well-rounded software developer and give back by mentoring others from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Highlights
Working on a real-world project with a group of driven peers was an amazing experience.
Gained hands-on exposure to collaborative coding practices, and version control using Git and GitHub.
Engaging with BBD staff who provided valuable industry insights, feedback, and support.
The tech talks and workshops broadened my knowledge of real-world software engineering practices and career paths.
I appreciated the friendly and inclusive environment, which made learning and asking questions easy.

Difficulties
Initially adjusting to the fast-paced environment and understanding the project requirements within a limited timeframe.
Some team communication challenges in the early stages, especially around roles and task distribution.

Recommendations for Improvements
Include optional short crash courses (30 mins) on tools like Git, Javascript, or the tech stack being used — especially for those with less exposure.
Introduce a check-in or feedback session to help teams correct their project approach earlier.
