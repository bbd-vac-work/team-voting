## Biogrpahy

I went to Pretoria Boys High School, and am now at the University of Pretoria in my final year of Computer engineering. My experience in webdev consists of 6 weeks of vacation work at BBD during 2024-2025. 

## Highlights

- I enjoyed optimising the performance of the QR code detection. I was comparing my code with an app I have on my phone which detects QR very quickly. I don't know if my code was faster but it was able to detect the code from significantly further away â€” 6 meters is where detection becomes unreliable. 

- Laptop
- Talking with people I haven't seen in a while

## Difficulties

 - I was sick the entire week and struggled to engage my 
 brain. 
 - We did less planning than I would have liked because the time frame was very short, and this lead to me constantly forgetting what I'm trying to do and what I need to do next once I finish.

## Recommendations for improvements

 - I think my biggest problem was that we couldn't really play the games as intended. We didn't really have the space to run around a shoot each other. And I think that also made it hard to judge how fun the game is. 
 - I think the other thing I would have appreciated would have been clarity on the usage of QR codes from the start. 
- Other than that I think everything was done very well.
