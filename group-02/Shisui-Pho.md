## Highlights

Working with people from other universities and getting to see other teams ideas on the projects.

## Difficulties

Working in a new environment like **vs code** and using new tools/frameworks/language like `JavaScript` with `Next.js`.

## Reccomendations for improvements
If more time, perhaps a week or two, were allocated for the projects, it would allow for deeper learning, especially since they often involve unfamiliar topics.
