Attendee Type: UFS Attendee 

## Biogrpahy

Matriculated in 2021 and took a gap year working as a tutor for high school students at an afternoon care. 
Started studying BSc Computer Science and Mathematics in 2022 and currently a 3rd year at UFS.

## Highlights

The highlight was when the application we worked on worked in the demo and we showed people what we achieved with the limited skills and knowledge we have.

## Difficulties

The difficulties were for me to learn a lot in a very short time and completing the work we needed to do. Stress and panic got to me, and I didnâ€™t think of obvious solutions like watching tutorials before starting working.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

For first time candidates, like me, it would be helpful to at least give a list of things to have ready and watch recommended videos on how to use some applications, for example GitHub because we do not use GitHub at UFS. This would save time because then team members have some basic knowledge on how to use it and work on that knowledge.
