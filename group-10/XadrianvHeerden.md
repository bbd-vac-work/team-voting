## Biogrpahy

I am Xadrian van Heerden, a Computer Science Honours student at University of Pretoria. I enjoy learning, exploring and living life.
I enjoy to jog, gym, bake and spend time with friends and family in my free time.
My interests in tech are split up in:
- Frontend development:
    - Next.js
    - Javascript 
- Backend development:
    - Nodejs
    - Nestjs
- Data analysis and development:
    - Jupyter Notebook python files and libraries
    - R environment

- Object oriented programming:
    - C++:
        - In this I enjoy especially exploring the compile-time domain and trying to move implementations to compile time to make the runtime quicker
        - Also enjoy exploring the creation and use of design patterns especially in C++.

## Highlights

This week learnt a lot into computer vision, especially the use of models, like tessaract and YOLO, this has also taught me how to implement it on the client side and integrating better with websockets in Nextjs.
This was also exciting to learn to work with new people and also learn using a little of WebRTC, even though it broke, have some idea and it was fun

## Difficulties

Understanding websockets better, and also dealing with computer vision and webRTC. It was a good learning curve and enjoyed the pressure and having a hackathon vibe.

## Recommendations for improvements

I don't have anything specifically to mention, it was a great experience and enjoyed the learning curve again.
