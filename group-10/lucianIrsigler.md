## Biography
Born in Johannesburg, 2002, I am someone who is passionate about building software and enjoy all the difficulties of building it. I am enjoy drawing(not well tho), watching series and working out. I also play games, mainly chill multiplayer games with friends. My favorite technology to work with is anything C++.


## Highlights
Meeting new people and interacting with people from other universities was the best part of the week. It provided opportunities to learn new perspectives. Additionally, building a somewhat working solution, when I thought the task was quite difficult, was quite satisfying.

Also the lunch and vending machine. Always top tier.

## Difficulties
The difficulity in the week lied in the team work aspect and stubbornness. We were kinda set on using OCR for the computer vision part, but we didn't do the proper research into preprocessing, so we wasted a lot of time on a solution that wasn't going to work. Potentailly also time management was a bit of an issue. 

## Recommendations for improvements
I think it ran well, and there arent much improvements I could suggest that couldn't be solved with a google search("links to learn git" for people unaware => answered by saying "google learn git").
