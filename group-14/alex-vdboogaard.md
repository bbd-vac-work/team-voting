Attendee Type: BBD Bursar

## Biography

Hi! I'm a 3rd-year BCom Informatics student at the University of Pretoria. I plan to pursue my honours in Informatics in 2026 and then join BBD as a junior software developer in 2027. I enjoy chess, rugby, and working on personal projects — one of which is a government gazette system, inspired by how poor the current implementation is by SA's government.

## Highlights

The highlight for me was demoing our project to the company and gaining valuable insights from their feedback. It genuinely improved my skills and helped me realise the importance of small details — like the title of a web page!

## Difficulties

I initially struggled with resolving merge conflicts, especially since my team frequently worked on the same files. However, I definitely improved as the week progressed.

## Recommendations for Improvement

It would be great to schedule a few sessions where attendees can chat with developers or BAs at BBD based on the projects they're working on. For example, groups interested in development on banking projects could chat with Employee X, while those curious about cellular projects could meet with Employee Y. Each group could rotate every 20 minutes to allow for meaningful discussions with different people.
