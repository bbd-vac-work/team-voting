## Biogrpahy

I am currently a BCOM Hons in Informatics Student at the University of Pretoria. 

## Highlights

The highlights of the week was being able to complete a semi-working game, initially I did not think I would be able to assist my group in any way. However, I was able to get the understanding of React and contribute to the frontend. (Although maybe Tailwind Css was not the best design decision). I even was able to assist with the WebSockets whch was a big victory to me. 

## Difficulties

The difficulties I encountered during the week was having to quickly grasp computer vision. I then realised I did have some "brief" experience with it as I created a QR code scanner for my final project last year that embed in our mobile app. 

## Reccomendations for improvements

Perfect the way it is ðŸ˜Š
