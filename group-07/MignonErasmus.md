# Mignon Erasmus

Attendee Type: BBD Bursar 

## Biogrpahy

I’m Mignon Erasmus, a BSc Honours Computer Science student at Tuks. I’m passionate about continuous learning and enjoy solving real-world problems through innovative software solutions.

## Highlights

This experience was both technically and personally rewarding, giving me the opportunity to work in a collaborative team environment while tackling a creative and engaging challenge.

One of the highlights for me was working on the WebSocket backend and integrating it with the frontend. This gave me practical experience in managing real-time communication and deepened my understanding of full-stack development. I also appreciated the chance to strengthen my skills in both frontend and backend technologies, deployment, and version control using GitHub.

Although I wasn’t directly involved in the computer vision aspect of the project, observing how it was implemented and playing around with it provided valuable exposure and broadened my understanding of its potential applications.

Overall, the project allowed me to apply what I’ve learned, build confidence in my abilities, and better understand the dynamics of working on a technical team.

## Difficulties

The main challenge I faced was the limited time available, as there were no significant technical difficulties during the project.
