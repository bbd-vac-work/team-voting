Attendee Type: Ukukhula Attendee

## Biogrpahy

I come from a village called Libode just ouside Mthatha where I matriculated. I studied BCom Accounting at NMU where I discovered Computer Science, so out of curiosity I did first year coding as an elective. When I graduated BCom Accounting, I worked for a few years until I realised that what I really want to do is to work in tech. So I made a lot sacrifice and landed up back at NMU studying CS in 2023. I spoke to my HOD about funding as I was on a student loan. I found myself on the BBD Ukukhula fund in November 2023. At this time I had never heard of BBD, I lost the funding same time because of poor academic results. When I found out BBD was doing a presentation at NMU in 2024, I took that opportunity to speak to Thabang about getting back on the program. I got back on with the hopes of attending Vac-Week, getting some mentorship and getting into the grad-program. But I was discouraged when I found that it was not open to NMU students. Until I got an invitation in 2025. The rest is history.

## Highlights

I got to network with some of the business analysts and developers who gave invaluable advice that I believe will help with my job application process. I was particularly curious about the culture and people in the company. I found that when you actually ask questions and keep out of your shell, people are willing to help where they can. And I saw that I am well aligned with the practical-fast-paced learning environment and the people there. So... "forget the code", The people there were the highlight of my week. I found out that I spoke to the CIO without even knowing it, I asked him if he's a developer there and he said "sort of" then later I asked a different dev who told me that no the white guy with long hair is Tony van der Linden. Imagine that :D

## Difficulties

I felt like I knew nothing at first. But after some of my team members, Clifford and Mignon explained what needed to happen, I was more than confident that I could play my role in front-end. Using git was foreign to me but now I want to implement it in my 3rd year project with my team at NMU. 

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Maybe make it a little bit more challenging - real life apps that actually solve an existing life problem, and have monetary prizes announced at the begining. 

## Gratitude
This program was a great eye opener. Thank you for inviting me and paying for the whole experience. Thank you for paying for my education. I am forever grateful for that. Thank you for doing over and above your roles and being good people to us as students. Your delivery made all the difference. I hope that one day I can extend the same level of kindness to younger developers and analysts. Keep it up!
