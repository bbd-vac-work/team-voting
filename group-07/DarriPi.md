# Darian Pietersen

Attendee Type: UFS Attendee

## Biogrpahy

My name is Darian Pietersen, and I’m currently a third-year student studying Computer Science and Business Management at the University of the Free State. I have a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and creativity—especially in game development. I completed Harvard’s CS50x course, which helped me build a solid foundation in Python, C, SQL, and computer science fundamentals. 
 
I’m a goal-driven person who enjoys learning new things, whether it’s technical subjects like software design or broader areas like economics. I was honoured to receive an academic merit award and be accepted into the Golden Key Honour Society for being in the top 15% of my faculty.

My long-term dream is to one day start my own game development company. I enjoy working in teams, thinking critically, and coming up with creative solutions that make technology more engaging and fun.

## Highlights

One of the highlights of the week was working on practical, hands-on projects and collaborating with other students who share similar interests. I really enjoyed the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned in a real setting. Seeing how different team members approached problems gave me new ideas and inspired me to think differently. The sessions that allowed us to build or brainstorm creative solutions—especially around tech or game ideas—were the most enjoyable and motivating.

## Difficulties

One challenge I faced was balancing time between the structured sessions and independent work. Sometimes it felt like we could’ve used a bit more flexibility or breathing space to properly focus on developing and testing ideas. 
Finally it was also a challenge to learn the new technology in such a short amount of time.

## Reccomendations for improvements

For next year, I think the vacation work week could be even better with a few changes:

* Have more structured time for independent project work and creativity

* Include breakout rooms or mentoring sessions where smaller groups can get feedback or guidance

Overall, I really appreciated the opportunity and learned a lot. I’m excited to keep growing and applying what I’ve learned in the future!
