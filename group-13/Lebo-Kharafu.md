## Biogrpahy

I am originally from Welkom Free-state, Born to code. 

## Highlights

I loved learning and building the Computer Vision models, however if was not added to the final product but still enjoyed making them.

## Difficulties

The challange was fun, and I would say the challange was communication,sockets and planning.

## Reccomendations for improvements

Because we struggled with planning and communication, I think an addition of making groups projects working together would be a fun challange to enable intergroup communication.
