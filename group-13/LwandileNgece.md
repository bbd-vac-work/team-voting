## Biogrpahy

I am a BITHons student at the University of Pretoria

## Highlights

The highlight of the week was working with different people you have just met for the first and building something together when you all have different skills.

## Difficulties

The difficulties was worthing with new things such as sockets and having to learn them in a short space of time and have a functioning system. Not getting enough sleep is another one.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

It was actually a good week when you reflect at the end of it. Maybe if at the end of it we could get peek into what a day for one of the seniors typically looks like.
